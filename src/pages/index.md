# Workfront Fusion API

The Adobe Workfront Fusion APIs enable you to programmatically build, manage, and operate automations across your enterprise systems.

## Overview

The Adobe Workfront Fusion APIs allow you to programmatically interact with Fusion to build, manage, and operate automations at scale. Using these APIs, you can perform many of the same actions available in the Fusion user interface, including managing connections, hooks, scenarios, executions, logs, and other core automation resources.

The APIs are being released incrementally and are currently marked as experimental. This documentation covers the initial public release, with additional endpoints and capabilities planned for future releases. The Fusion team is actively developing and expanding the API surface, and updates will be published as new functionality becomes available.

#### Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you are familiar with:
*	Adobe Workfront Fusion concepts, such as scenarios, connections, hooks, and executions
*	Basic REST API principles (HTTP methods, authentication headers, request/response payloads)
*	Adobe Identity and Adobe Developer Console project setup

For an introduction to Fusion concepts and UI-based automation, see the [Adobe Workfront Fusion product documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/home).
For APIs that manage Workfront work management objects (projects, tasks, and issues), see the [Adobe Workfront Platform APIs](https://developer-stage.adobe.com/workfront-apis/).
