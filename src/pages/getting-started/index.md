# Getting Started   

## Introducing the Workfront Fusion API

The **public API release** for the Workfront Fusion API marks an exciting milestone for programmatically managing and automating Fusion workflows. Built on **API version 3**, the Fusion API enables developers to integrate Fusion capabilities directly into their applications, automate scenario management, and build custom automation solutions.

## Experimental Phase

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text" />

The Fusion API is currently in an **experimental phase** as we actively develop and refine the platform. This designation means that while the API is functional and ready for integration, endpoints, request/response structures, and features may evolve based on user feedback and technical requirements. We recommend staying updated with the latest documentation.

### Upcoming Features

The Fusion API roadmap includes expanded functionality for:

- **Operations Reporting**: Detailed insights into scenario operations and performance metrics
- **Execution History**: Comprehensive access to scenario execution logs and historical data
- Additional endpoints for advanced workflow management

## Getting Started with Integration

To begin integrating with the Workfront Fusion API, follow these steps:

1. **[Credentials](./credentials/index.md)** - Set up OAuth Server-to-Server authentication through the Adobe Developer Console

2. **[Authentication Guide](./authentication/index.md)** - Learn how to generate and use access tokens to securely call the Fusion API

3. **[API Headers](./api_headers/index.md)** - Understand the required headers for properly formatting your API requests

4. **[Technical Accounts](./technical_accounts/index.md)** - Configure permissions for technical accounts to control access

5. **[Usage Notes](./usage_notes/index.md)** - Review API usage guidelines and best practices

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the setup process, you'll be ready to explore available endpoints in the [API Reference](../api/index.md). Additional capabilities for building automations, integrating Fusion into your applications, and creating custom tooling will become available as the API continues to evolve.

Let's get started building with the Workfront Fusion API!
