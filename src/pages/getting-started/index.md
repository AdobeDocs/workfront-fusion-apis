# Getting Started   

## Introducing the Workfront Fusion API

The Workfront Fusion API marks an exciting milestone as **public API release** for programmatically managing and automating Fusion workflows. Built on **API version 3**, the Fusion API enables developers to integrate Fusion capabilities directly into their applications, automate scenario management, and build custom automation solutions.

## Experimental Phase

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text" />

The Fusion API is currently in an **experimental phase** as we actively develop and refine the platform. This designation means that while the API is functional and ready for integration, endpoints, request/response structures, and features may evolve based on user feedback and technical requirements. We recommend staying updated with the latest documentation.

### Upcoming Features

The Fusion API roadmap includes expanded functionality for:

- **Operations Reporting**: Detailed insights into scenario operations and performance metrics
- **Execution History**: Comprehensive access to scenario execution logs and historical data
- Additional endpoints for advanced workflow management

## Getting Started with Integration

To begin integrating with the Workfront Fusion API, follow these steps:

1. **[Create Credentials](./credentials/index.md)** - Organization admins set up OAuth Server-to-Server authentication through the Adobe Developer Console

2. **[Authentication Guide](./authentication/index.md)** - Learn how to generate and use access tokens to securely call the Fusion API

3. **[API Headers](./api_headers/index.md)** - Understand the required headers for properly formatting your API requests

4. **[Technical Accounts](./technical_accounts/index.md)** - Configure permissions for technical accounts to control access

5. **[Usage Notes](./usage_notes/index.md)** - Review API usage guidelines and best practices

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the setup process, you'll be ready to:

- Explore available endpoints in the [API Reference](../api/index.md)
- Build automations to manage scenarios programmatically
- Integrate Fusion capabilities into your applications
- Create custom tooling for your Fusion workflows

Let's get started building with the Workfront Fusion API!
